The redaction history functionality enables you to track and communicate content modifications to readers. 
Within the post's front matter, you can specify details such as `editor`, `reviewer`, and include explanatory notes (`note`) about the changes made.
This feature requires manual configuration in the post's front matter section.

```toml
